# Bot Guide

This is a guide on how to use a bot and run it from A to Z. Before we begin, please note that this guide is the property of Rayan and should not be sold without his permission.

## Inviting the Bot

First, you need to invite the bot to your server by clicking on the link provided by the bot creator. Once the bot is on your server, you can use it by typing commands in the chat. The prefix for the commands is usually a symbol like "!" or "-" and you can choose it from the config.js file.

## Using the Bot

To get a list of all the available commands, type "!help" or "-help" in the chat. This will give you a list of all the commands.

To use a command, type the prefix followed by the command name, for example: "-help".

## Additional Information

The bot may have some problems, but it will be updated to v14 soon.

The bot is made by [!RAYAN#8535](https://discord.com/users/911051728282079262) and [Falcon Development](https://discord.gg/mgeU49KWzp). Please do not sell or buy the bot because it is originally free, and also the bot with the rights of the [Falcon Store](https://discord.gg/mgeU49KWzp) and with the rights of [!RAYAN#8535](https://discord.com/users/911051728282079262). In the event that you settle something with the bot other than modification without the permission of the bot owners, you may face consequences.
